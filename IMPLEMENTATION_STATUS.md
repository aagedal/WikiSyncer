# WikiSyncer implementation status

Updated: 2026-08-21

## Completed backlog items

1. Cargo workspace, formatting and lint policy, macOS/Linux CI, and dependency
   license/source policy.
2. Validated core identities, explicit-title and category collection rules, and all
   planned history-policy variants.
3. Bounded MediaWiki Action API client, 100-title batching spike, resumable revision
   metadata pagination, retry classification, and offline loopback fixture harness.
4. SQLite migration 1 and a bounded atomic loose-object store with domain-separated
   BLAKE3 identities, Zstandard compression, durable installation, deduplication, and
   verified reads. Logical content identity is isolated from physical locations.
5. Explicit-title resolution and current-revision capture, including exact revision
   source retrieval, content-model/size/MediaWiki SHA-1 validation, schema migration
   2 for wiki/page/revision/collection metadata, missing-title observations, and
   idempotent durable capture.
6. Deterministic normalized plain text and minimal Markdown with output-specific
   transformer versions, conservative structural/inline wikitext handling, readable
   placeholders for unsupported templates, malformed-input bounds, and golden article
   fixtures.
7. Contentless SQLite FTS5 indexing for selected current revisions with separately
   weighted title, alias, heading, body, category, and caption fields; atomic derived
   index replacement during capture; wiki filters and bounded ranked queries; and CLI
   `search`/`show` commands with human-readable or JSON output and exact-source mode.
8. Bounded complete-history enumeration with opaque MediaWiki continuation, reuse of
   already captured revision bodies, immutable metadata consistency checks, and
   durable historical inserts that do not move the current page head or search index;
   newest-first local history queries; deterministic exact-source and normalized
   reading diffs with line alignment and word-level spans; and CLI `history`, `diff`,
   and `show --revision` commands with human-readable or JSON output.
9. Durable, idempotent synchronization runs and jobs with crash recovery of claimed
   and retryable-failed work; structured error history and aggregate job counts;
   whole-source and collection-scoped RecentChanges checkpoints with configurable
   overlap windows; checkpoint advancement gated on successful durable jobs; and CLI
   `status` output in human-readable and JSON forms.
10. A loopback-only Axum reader with home, search, article, history, revision, diff,
    changes, collections, and source/integrity routes; bundled styling, restrictive
    Content Security Policy and response headers, sanitized derived HTML, same-wiki
    local article links, provenance notices, CLI `serve`, and an in-process crawl
    proving every loaded resource remains local or embedded.

## Next backlog item

11. Prove the complete offline vertical slice.

Milestone gates remain tracked in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`; an item being complete
means its initial implementation is present, not that its later milestone hardening
is finished.
